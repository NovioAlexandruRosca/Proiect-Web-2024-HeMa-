<h3>Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
            <p>
                This document is intended for the two developers of the site involved in the development and deployment
                of the web application, serving as an outline for the overall website. The targeted audience also includes
                the users of the website and the coordonator(s) of the project (<a role="doc-biblioref"
                    href="#ref-FII-UAIC">Web technologies professors</a> from <a href="https://www.uaic.ro/">UAIC
                    University</a>). Readers are encouraged to start with the <a href="#abstract">Introduction
                    chapter</a> and progress to sections relevant to their role or interest.
            </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Context</h3>
<p>In the current landscape of digital publishing, many academic fields face the challenge of efficiently managing scientific data in an accessible and structured format. Despite the availability of advanced documentation technologies, much of the valuable information generated in research remains encapsulated in unstructured formats, which significantly limits their potential for discovery and subsequent use.</p>
<p>HeMa (Herbal Web Manager) is a platform designed to address these challenges, offering an integrated solution for managing, presenting, and exchanging botanical information. Utilizing the Scholarly HTML format, HeMa proposes a standardized and extensible methodology for documenting and sharing knowledge in the field of botany. This enriched format allows not only the precise representation of scientific data but also advanced interaction with it, while supporting the principles of accessibility and internationalization.</p>
<p>According to a report from the New York Times, the introduction of structured information into their culinary recipes improved their discoverability, leading to an immediate 52% increase in traffic. This example highlights the significant benefits that structuring and standardizing data can bring in any field, including the academic and scientific domain.</p>
<p>HeMa applies these principles by offering a platform where scientific articles, plant collections, and user blogs are managed and presented in a way that not only improves accessibility and discoverability but also enhances interactivity and the overall functionality of the content. This approach places a significant burden on tool developers and service providers who must explore the world of extracting data from static publications and build a complex set of tools while simultaneously offering interoperability and opportunities for cooperative improvements.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, HeMa adopts an approach rooted in established best practices for the reuse of open and standardized formats. We propose an "HTML Vernacular", a set of guidelines for creating domain-specific data formats that utilize the inherent extensibility of HTML. This vernacular foundation, overlaid with schema.org metadata and proposed extensions to it, has produced a format for the authoring and exchange of scholarly articles built on open standards, ready for use by everyone, including independent researchers who choose to publish their articles on their own.</p>

                computer. It can be downloaded from this <a
                    href="https://github.com/NovioAlexandruRosca/Proiect-Web-2024-HeMa-">GitHub</a> page.
            </p>
            <p>As for the end user perspective, this product shouldn't require too high specifications, as an internet
                connection and a web browser will suffice. Even if the used browser isn't compatible with all of the
                product's features, there should be some fallback methods, allowind the user experience to be as close
                as possible to the maximum potentional of the website.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that our product will be available on any type of device (PCs, phones, tablets,
                etc.). Therefore, its design shall be responsive.
            </p>
            <h3><span></span>User Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                Our users can find a <code>README.md</code> file on the previously specified GitHub Repository. The
                choosen design for our product should be simple enough to make the user experience as intuitive as
                possible, thus overcomind the need for documentation. However, there will be a page which will inform
                all the users of the limitations imposed by our website, mainly the number of photos that can be
                collected in a period of time from another application. If any, the limitations of uploading a photo to
                these websites will be also documented.
            </p>
<h3>Performance Requirements</h3>
<p>In addition to being responsive across various frame sizes, including monitors, laptops, tablets, and phones, the website is optimized for quick load times and smooth transitions between pages. The dynamic content loading feature ensures that users experience minimal wait times as they navigate through the extensive plant collections and blog entries.</p>

<h3>Security Requirements</h3>
<p>Beyond the hashing of passwords, the website employs advanced encryption techniques to safeguard user data during transmission and storage. All personal data management conforms to GDPR standards, ensuring user consent and data rights are at the forefront of our platform's operation.</p>
<p>
    HeMa will encrypt all sensitive user data, including passwords and personal information, while storing them. 
    Also, it will use secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, for all data
    transmission between clients and server.
</p>
<p>
    HeMa website must implement measures to prevent code injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection
    or command injection. Input validation and sanitization must be performed on all user-supplied data to
    ensure that it does not contain malicious code.

This includes periodic reviews of user agreements and privacy statements, as well as incorporating user feedback to address any concerns related to data handling and user rights.</p>

<h3>Business Rules</h3>
            <p>
                The final product will have two different types of users, they wont have to respect the same rules on the website.
                All of them will need to log into our website, through the login page but one will choose to log as an admin and one as a user. 
                There won't be any given restrictions to the registred accounts. Only the developers will have access to the website's
                database. The admins will be able to generate pdf/csv files containg data related to plants and the users of the platform, see all the
                users and ban anyone who doesnt respect the internal rules.
            </p>
