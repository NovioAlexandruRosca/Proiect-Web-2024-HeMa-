<h1>HeMa (Herbal Web Manager)</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>HeMa (Herbal Web Manager) represents an innovative implementation of a plant collection management system structured in an advanced document format known as Scholarly HTML. This web platform facilitates not only the management and cataloging of botanical species by enthusiasts and researchers but also provides extended blogging functionalities and community interaction all accessible through an optimized web interface. This documentation details the architecture, encoding, and functionalities of the system, with a particular emphasis on interoperability with modern browsers and the adoption of open standards for the exchange of scholarly articles. Utilizing Scholarly HTML, HeMa aims to set a new standard in digital publishing in the field of botany, enhancing the accessibility, discovery, and management of data in an academic and research environment.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the current landscape of digital publishing, many academic fields face the challenge of efficiently managing scientific data in an accessible and structured format. Despite the availability of advanced documentation technologies, much of the valuable information generated in research remains encapsulated in unstructured formats, which significantly limits their potential for discovery and subsequent use.</p>
<p>HeMa (Herbal Web Manager) is a platform designed to address these challenges, offering an integrated solution for managing, presenting, and exchanging botanical information. Utilizing the Scholarly HTML format, HeMa proposes a standardized and extensible methodology for documenting and sharing knowledge in the field of botany. This enriched format allows not only the precise representation of scientific data but also advanced interaction with it, while supporting the principles of accessibility and internationalization.</p>
<p>According to a report from the New York Times, the introduction of structured information into their culinary recipes improved their discoverability, leading to an immediate 52% increase in traffic. This example highlights the significant benefits that structuring and standardizing data can bring in any field, including the academic and scientific domain.</p>
<p>HeMa applies these principles by offering a platform where scientific articles, plant collections, and user blogs are managed and presented in a way that not only improves accessibility and discoverability but also enhances interactivity and the overall functionality of the content. This approach places a significant burden on tool developers and service providers who must explore the world of extracting data from static publications and build a complex set of tools while simultaneously offering interoperability and opportunities for cooperative improvements.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, HeMa adopts an approach rooted in established best practices for the reuse of open and standardized formats. We propose an "HTML Vernacular", a set of guidelines for creating domain-specific data formats that utilize the inherent extensibility of HTML. This vernacular foundation, overlaid with schema.org metadata and proposed extensions to it, has produced a format for the authoring and exchange of scholarly articles built on open standards, ready for use by everyone, including independent researchers who choose to publish their articles on their own.</p>
