March 25, 2024 - Present

## Description
This project aims to develop a Digital Herbarium web application, providing support for organizing collections of graphical representations of pressed plants and their associated attributes. Leveraging multi-criteria search capabilities, the application will generate, recommend, and share thematic albums such as medicinal plants, mountain flowers, and more. For relevant photographs, public APIs like Unsplash will be considered.
Various statistics will be generated and made available in open formats, including minimal, CSV, and PDF. Additionally, a ranking of the most popular collected plants will be created, also available as an RSS feed.
